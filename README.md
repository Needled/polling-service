# polling-service
Web service that allows user to add services with name and url, manipulate them and monitor their status

* Package name: 'com.kry.demo.pollingService'

# Getting Started

**Setup locally on any cli:**

1) Setup a MySql database and create services table as defined in the schema at src/main/resources/scripts/services_schema.sql
2) Configure database properties in src/main/resources/application.yml with your local setup.
3) Run as a spring boot application with: `gradlew bootRun` at the project root.
4) After starting the application, you can access the api documentation [UI](http://localhost:8088/swagger-ui.html) as well
as in [JSON](http://localhost:8088/v3/api-docs) format
5) To start [front end component](http://localhost:3000), navigate to src/web and follow instructions there.
   
**Run with docker-compose:**

1) Ensure you have docker installed (depending on your OS you may need other prerequisites, like virtualization for windows)
2) Navigate to the project root and setup project with: `docker-compose up`
3) This will automatically initialize a mysql db on port 3306 and create the required table, 
as well as run [the spring boot api](http://localhost:8088/swagger-ui.html) and the [front end component](http://localhost:3000), 
ready for use.
